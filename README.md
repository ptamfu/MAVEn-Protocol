Two main takeaways from placing thermocouples inside two of the chambers to measure the temperature of the air inside them while the whole thing was running. Started at 20C, then raised the temperature to 30C, then dropped it to 18C 
1) the chambers take about 20 minutes to reach the temperature set-point after making the change on the controller
2) the chambers on the edge are actually pretty close in temp to the ones in the middle, only 0.4 degrees C off when they were set to the high temp (30c) and only about 0.25 degrees C off when at the lower temperature (18c).
